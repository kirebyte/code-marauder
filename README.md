# Code-Marauder üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

---

**Code-Marauder** is a tool written in Go that crawls through a source code repository and generates a single, flattened text file containing all the code files in a clean, structured listing.

It's designed to help **AI systems** (especially large language models) read and understand entire projects more efficiently, without having to navigate dozens of files or complex directory structures.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Converts full source code repos into a single `.txt` file.
- Designed for AI input, summarization, and programmatic inspection.
- Lightweight and fast.
- Highly configurable via environment variables.

---

## üß∞ Installation

Make sure you have Go 1.21+ installed, then run:

```bash
go install github.com/kirebyte/code-marauder@latest
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. Set the required environment variables:

```bash
export CODE_LISTING_DIRS="./myproject"
export CODE_LISTING_FILE="./output/listing.txt"
export CODE_LISTING_ALLOWED_FILES=".go,.ts,.js,.py,.java"
```

CODE_LISTING_DIRS can be a comma-separated list of folders.

2. Run the tool:

```bash
code-marauder
```

You will get a full code listing at the path defined in CODE_LISTING_FILE.
Each file will be wrapped like this:

```text
==== File: ./path/to/file.go ====
<file content>
==== End of File ====
```
